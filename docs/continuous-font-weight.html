      font gives you a lot of control over the font-weight property. I'm doing
      some tests to see how well I can animate that property. It's a little
      trickier than it should be, but it's basically working.

    <div class="help">
      This first example shows what happens when you change the font-weight
      property continuously. The X's and the O's both change the same amount.
      The O's move at the same pace as the font changes, to make it more clear
      what is going on. The two rows move at different paces just to see how the
      effect looks.

      This next example shows multiple font weights without animation. Currently
      I'm <i>only</i> importing these exact font weights from the Google Fonts
      API. I should be able to import <i>all</i> weights, but I can't figure out
      how to do that. If I add twice as many rows to <i>this fixed</i> example,
      you can see the limitation clearly. However, in the
      <i>animation</i> example it's hard to tell that the font-weight is not
      changing continuously.

      <a id="anti_aliasing"></a>This next example uses the font-weight property
      to add <b>Anti-Aliasing</b> to ASCII art. I'm currently using all X's for
      simplicity. I can imagine drawing a grayscale picture using the
      font-weight attribute. Normally people use different characters to draw
      ASCII art in different shades of (simulated) gray. Using the font-weight
      would allow me to pick any characters I wanted; in particular I might use
      some text that is relevant to the picture.

      I draw the "Waves" example by directly setting the font-weight of each
      character. That was a pain to code, so in the "Circles" example I first
      draw to the canvas then copy the contents of the canvas to the X's. Now I
      can use <i>any</i> method of drawing on a canvas to get this effect. E.g.
      loading pictures from JPEG files, reading individual frames from a video,
      rendering a 3d animation with the ThreeJS library, etc.

      I'm displaying these two canvasses only for debug reasons. The first shows
      one large square for each X on the screen. The second is scaled so the
      oversized pixels have the same aspect ratio as the X's. In production code
      you'd only need one canvas, and there is no need to display it.
